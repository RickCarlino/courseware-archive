# Angular / React Training Materials

Demonstrations and slides from when I was a corporate trainer in 2015/2016. 

# Where to Look

 * Angular Slides: `slides/`
 * React Slides: `react/slides`

**Where are the demos?** React demos are inside `react/` folder. Angular content is named after the corresponding topic.

Example: Find "UI Data Grid" demos in `ui-data-grid/`.
